# Diabetes Prediction Analysis

## Dataset Information

- The dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
- The primary objective of this dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements.
- All patients in the dataset are females, at least 21 years old, and of Pima Indian Heritage.
- The dataset comprises 9 columns, with the dependent variable being "Outcome" and the independent variables as follows:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI (Body Mass Index)
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age

## Data Overview

- No missing values are present in the dataset, ensuring completeness and reliability.
- The most influential features for prediction are identified as Glucose Level, BMI, and Age.

## Diabetes Prediction Model

To predict whether a patient is diabetic or not, follow these steps:

1. **Input Data:**
   - Enter the relevant details of the patient, including:
     - Pregnancies
     - Glucose Level
     - Blood Pressure
     - Skin Thickness
     - Insulin
     - BMI
     - Diabetes Pedigree Function
     - Age

2. **Model Prediction:**
   - Utilize the developed model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the input data.

3. **Interpretation:**
   - Analyze the model prediction to determine whether the patient is diabetic or not.

### Key Features

- **Pregnancies:**
  - Represents the number of pregnancies the patient has had.

- **Glucose Level:**
  - High significance in predicting diabetes.

- **Blood Pressure:**
  - Blood pressure measurement of the patient.

- **Skin Thickness:**
  - Thickness of the patient's skin.

- **Insulin:**
  - Insulin levels in the patient's body.

- **BMI (Body Mass Index):**
  - Important factor influencing diabetes prediction.

- **Diabetes Pedigree Function:**
  - A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.

- **Age:**
  - Age of the patient.

## Note

This model is specifically designed for females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian Heritage. The accuracy and reliability of predictions may vary for individuals outside this demographic. Always consult healthcare professionals for accurate diagnosis and advice.
